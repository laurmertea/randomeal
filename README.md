# randomeal
A random meal generator for when you are feeling hungry

This is a project meant to test working with a public API.

Using [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/ 'TheMealDB: An open, crowd-sourced database of Recipes from around the world')'s public API we'll be able to get a random meal and display it on our web page.

In version 1.0, based on the data that we can get through a [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API 'Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network)') API request, we'll show the following meal details:
- meal name
- meal category
- meal image
- a Youtube video with the meal recipe
- the meal ingredients

In future versions you should be able to select a few things about yourself and the meal you're interested in.
